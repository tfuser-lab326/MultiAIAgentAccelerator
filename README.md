&nbsp;[![Agent Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/Microsoft-Agent%20Framework-purple)](https://learn.microsoft.com/agent-framework/)

A multi-agent AI solution that automates **prior authorization** for health plan payers. Four specialized **Foundry Hosted Agents** — Compliance, Clinical Reviewer, Coverage, and Synthesis — evaluate PA requests against coverage policies and produce auditable approve/pend recommendations in under 2 minutes. Built with **Microsoft Foundry**, the **Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)**, **Azure Container Apps**, and **MCP healthcare data servers**.

The solution supports **two runtime modes**:

| Mode | How to start | What happens |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Foundry Hosted Agent** (recommended) | `azd up` | Agents are registered with Microsoft Foundry Hosted Agents (refreshed preview); each agent gets a dedicated endpoint that the backend invokes through `AIProjectClient.get_openai_client(agent_name=...)` with `DefaultAzureCredential`. Foundry manages the container lifecycle. |
| **Local / Docker Compose** | `docker compose up` | All 4 agent containers + backend + frontend run locally — no Azure deployment needed. |

Decision policy and evaluation methodology adapted from the [Anthropic prior-auth-review-skill](https://github.com/anthropics/healthcare/tree/main/prior-auth-review-skill): LENIENT mode decision policy, per-criterion MET/NOT_MET/INSUFFICIENT evaluation, confidence scoring, progressive gate evaluation, structured audit trails, NCCI bundling risk flagging, service-type classification, and provider specialty-procedure appropriateness as an auditable criterion.

<a id="getting-started"></a>
## Getting Started

See the [Deployment Guide](./docs/DeploymentGuide.md) for full prerequisites and step-by-step instructions.

**Prerequisites:** Azure subscription · [azd ≥ 1.18.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) · Docker · [GPT-5.4 access request](https://aka.ms/OAI/gpt53codexaccess)

```bash
# Deploy to Azure (recommended — Foundry Hosted Agent mode)
azd auth login
azd up

# Or run everything locally (no Azure required)
docker compose up
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Model access required:** GPT-5.4 requires a separate access request before it can be deployed. [Apply for access here](https://aka.ms/OAI/gpt53codexaccess). Deployment will fail if access has not been granted to your subscription.

## Guidance

### Architecture

This solution uses a **stateless dispatcher** pattern: the FastAPI backend has no local AI runtime — all specialist reasoning runs in four independent Foundry Hosted Agent containers. The orchestrator dispatches to each agent's dedicated Foundry endpoint via `AIProjectClient(allow_preview=True).get_openai_client(agent_name=...)` with `DefaultAzureCredential`. See [Architecture](./docs/architecture.md) for the full design.

### Security

- **Keyless by design** — all Azure resource access uses `DefaultAzureCredential`; no API keys or connection strings are stored anywhere
- **Managed Identity** — each Container App has a system-assigned managed identity with least-privilege Bicep-assigned role assignments (`CognitiveServicesOpenAIUser`, `Azure AI User`); the deployer additionally receives `Azure AI Project Manager` (project scope) so the `azd ai agent` extension can call `create_version()` on Hosted Agent definitions, and a `postdeploy` hook grants `Azure AI User` to each agent's per-instance Application identity provisioned by the extension
- **Local auth disabled** — the Azure AI Foundry account has `disableLocalAuth: true`, enforcing Entra ID-only access
- See [Security guidelines](#security-guidelines) below for additional hardening recommendations for production deployments handling PHI

### Responsible AI

This is an **AI-assisted triage tool** — all recommendations are drafts that require human clinical review before any authorization decision is finalized. Coverage policies reflect Medicare LCDs/NCDs only; commercial and Medicare Advantage plans may differ. See [TRANSPARENCY_FAQ.md](./TRANSPARENCY_FAQ.md) for full responsible AI transparency details.

### Key features

<details open>
  <summary><b>Multi-agent parallel execution</b></summary>

  - Compliance and Clinical agents run concurrently via `asyncio.gather`, reducing wall-clock time from 20+ minutes to under 2 minutes per case
  - Coverage Agent runs sequentially after clinical findings are available
  - Synthesis Agent executes the gate-based rubric to generate the final recommendation and confidence
  - Four-phase pipeline: Pre-flight → Parallel → Sequential → Synthesis → Audit
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Foundry Hosted Agent architecture</b></summary>

  - Each of the 4 specialist agents has its own `main.py`, `schemas.py`, `Dockerfile`, `agent.yaml`, and `skills/` directory under `agents/<name>/`
  - Agents use the refreshed Foundry Hosted Agents preview stack (`agent-framework-core` + `agent-framework-foundry` + `agent-framework-foundry-hosting`): `Agent` is wrapped by `ResponsesHostServer(agent).run()` and `default_options={"response_format": PydanticModel, "store": False}` enforces token-level structured output — no JSON fence parsing
  - The FastAPI backend is a **pure HTTP dispatcher** — it has no local AI runtime; all specialist reasoning runs in the four independent agent containers
  - Each agent container exposes `POST /responses` (Foundry Responses API protocol) and is independently versioned, deployable, and scalable
  - `hosted_agents.py` is a **two-mode dispatcher**: direct HTTP to agent containers (Docker Compose), or per-agent dedicated Foundry endpoints via `AIProjectClient(allow_preview=True).get_openai_client(agent_name=...)` with `DefaultAzureCredential` (Foundry Hosted Agents)
  - Agents are built and registered with Foundry by `azd deploy` itself — each agent has a `host: azure.ai.agent` entry in `azure.yaml` that the `azd ai agent` extension uses to ACR-build the image, push it, call `create_version()`, and provision the per-agent runtime + blueprint identities. A `postdeploy` hook (`scripts/grant_agent_rbac.py`) then grants `Azure AI User` to each runtime identity so the agents can call the Responses API. Foundry manages the ACA container lifecycle; no self-managed ACA modules in Bicep
  - `scripts/check_agents.py` runs automatically after registration to verify all agents, App Insights, backend, and frontend are healthy before the deployment completes
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Skills-based architecture</b></summary>

  - Agent behaviors defined in SKILL.md files — domain experts can update clinical rules without code changes
  - SKILL.md files live alongside each agent container under `agents/<name>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
  - Loaded at agent startup via MAF `SkillsProvider` — no backend code changes needed to update clinical rules
  - Compliance skill: 10-item checklist (NCCI bundling + service type classification added as items 9 and 10)
  - Coverage skill: Provider Specialty-Procedure Appropriateness is now a required explicit criterion (Step 1.4)
  - Clinical skill: low-confidence extraction banner when `extraction_confidence < 60%` surfaces directly in the frontend Clinical tab
  - Synthesis skill: emits `synthesis_audit_trail` (gate results + weighted confidence breakdown) visible in the frontend Synthesis tab
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>MCP-powered data access</b></summary>

  - Five remote MCP servers: NPI Registry, ICD-10 Codes, CMS Coverage, Clinical Trials (DeepSense), PubMed (Anthropic Healthcare MCP)
  - Each agent container calls MCP servers directly via `MCPStreamableHTTPTool` (configured via `MCP_*` env vars)
  - DeepSense servers use Key-based auth with `User-Agent: claude-code/1.0` header (handled by a shared `httpx.AsyncClient` in each agent container); PubMed uses unauthenticated access
  - PubMed uses `_ReconnectingMCPTool` to auto-reconnect on idle session expiry (~10 min TTL)
  - All agents use `FoundryChatClient` with gpt-5.4 on Microsoft Foundry (refreshed preview)
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Gate-based decision rubric</b></summary>

  - Three sequential gates: Provider → Codes → Medical Necessity
  - LENIENT mode: only APPROVE or PEND — never DENY
  - Per-criterion MET/NOT_MET/INSUFFICIENT assessment with confidence scoring
  - Configurable: switch to STRICT mode (adds DENY) via configuration toggle
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Human-in-the-loop decision panel</b></summary>

  - Accept or Override the AI recommendation with documented rationale
  - Override traceability: flows to notification letters, audit PDF, and API response
  - Authorization number generation (PA-YYYYMMDD-XXXXX)
  - PDF notification letters (approval and pend) with clinical justification data
  - All four agents visible in tabbed Agent Details: Compliance checklist, Clinical extraction (with low-confidence banner), Coverage criteria (including specialty-procedure match), and **Synthesis** gate pipeline + weighted confidence breakdown + disclaimer
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Audit and compliance</b></summary>

  - 10-item compliance checklist with blocking/non-blocking classification; items 9 (NCCI bundling risk) and 10 (service type classification) are new domain-aware improvements over the baseline Anthropic skill
  - Provider Specialty-Procedure Appropriateness as a required, auditable `criteria_assessment` entry in the Coverage Agent — sourced from NPI Registry taxonomy
  - Per-criterion confidence scoring with weighted formula (40% criteria + 30% extraction + 20% compliance + 10% policy)
  - `synthesis_audit_trail` with `gate_results` and `confidence_components` surfaced in the frontend Synthesis tab
  - 8-section audit justification document (Markdown + color-coded PDF)
  - Diagnosis-Policy Alignment as a required auditable criterion
  - Complete data source attribution and timestamp tracking
  - Section 9 added on clinician override with full override record
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Real-time progress streaming</b></summary>

  - SSE (Server-Sent Events) for live progress updates
  - Phase timeline with per-agent status cards and elapsed timer
  - 9 progress events across 5 phases (preflight → phase_1 → phase_2 → phase_3 → phase_4)
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Observability</b></summary>

  - Azure Application Insights integration via OpenTelemetry
  - Custom phase spans with semantic attributes (recommendation, confidence, agent status)
  - Microsoft Foundry hosted agents provide native runtime and evaluation visibility when hosted mode is enabled
  - Application Map, Transaction Search, Live Metrics, and Performance views
</details>

### Prerequisites and costs

To deploy this solution accelerator, ensure you have access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with the necessary permissions to create resource groups and resources. The **Microsoft Foundry Resource and Project** are automatically provisioned by `azd up`. The solution uses the **Azure OpenAI gpt-5.4** model, which is automatically deployed as part of `azd up` — see [Azure OpenAI model availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models) for details.

> [!WARNING]
> **Validate region availability before deploying.** This solution depends on **two preview features** that are NOT available in every Azure region. Deploying to an unsupported region will fail during `azd up`.
>
> **1. Foundry Hosted Agents (preview)** — required to run the 4 agents (`clinical-reviewer`, `compliance`, `coverage-assessment`, `synthesis`). Check the official supported region list before picking a location:
> - 📍 [Hosted Agents — Region availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/concepts/hosted-agents#region-availability)
>
> **2. Azure OpenAI `gpt-5.4` model** — required for agent reasoning. Currently available in **East US 2** (`eastus2`) and **Sweden Central** (`swedencentral`):
> - 📍 [Azure OpenAI model availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models)
>
> **Recommended regions** (both features confirmed available): **East US 2** or **Sweden Central**.
>
> | Deployment Type | Data Residency | Regions |
> |----------------|---------------|--------|
> | **GlobalStandard** (default) | No guarantee — data may be processed in any region | East US 2, Sweden Central |
> | **DataZoneStandard** | Data stays within geographic zone (US/EU) | East US 2 **only** |
>
> - **Sweden Central** automatically uses **GlobalStandard** (the only supported type for that region) — no prompt is shown.
> - **East US 2** prompts you to choose between **GlobalStandard** and **DataZoneStandard** during `azd up`.
>
> If you need data residency, select East US 2 and choose DataZoneStandard.

## <img src="./docs/images/readme/business-scenario.svg" width="48" /> Business Scenario

|![Prior Authorization Review — Application Interface](./docs/images/readme/interface.png)|
|---|

<br/>

Healthcare organizations processing prior authorization (PA) requests face significant challenges in coordinating complex clinical reviews across multiple departments. They must evaluate medical necessity, verify coverage policies, and produce auditable decisions — often under strict regulatory timelines. Some of the challenges they face include:

- **High volume** — U.S. providers submit ~[300 million PA requests per year](https://www.caqh.org/insights/caqh-index-report) (CAQH Index)
- **Manual, time-consuming reviews** — each request takes [15–20 minutes](https://web.archive.org/web/20240829144735/https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/prior-authorization-survey.pdf) of clinician and staff time (AMA, 2024)
- **Slow turnaround** — average PA decision takes [5–14 business days](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/cms-interoperability-and-prior-authorization-final-rule-cms-0057-f)
- **Inconsistent assessments** — manual reviews are subject to reviewer variability
- **Regulatory pressure** — CMS mandates [electronic PA by 2026–2027](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/cms-interoperability-and-prior-authorization-final-rule-cms-0057-f) with 72-hour urgent and 7-day standard response limits (CMS-0057-F)

By using the *Prior Authorization Review — Multi-Agent Solution Accelerator*, organizations can automate these processes, ensuring that all clinical reviews are accurately coordinated, auditable, and executed efficiently.

### Business value
<details>
  <summary>Click to learn more about what value this solution provides</summary>

  - **Reduce review time from 20+ minutes to under 2 minutes** <br/>
  Compliance and Clinical agents run concurrently via parallel execution, dramatically reducing wall-clock time per case.

  - **Ensure consistency and auditability** <br/>
  Gate-based decision rubric with per-criterion MET/NOT_MET/INSUFFICIENT scoring eliminates reviewer variability and produces complete audit trails.

  - **Maintain human oversight** <br/>
  AI produces draft recommendations; human reviewers Accept or Override with documented rationale — every decision is traceable.

  - **Scale without proportional staffing** <br/>
  Stateless API design enables horizontal scaling behind a load balancer. Skills-based architecture lets domain experts update clinical rules without code changes.

  - **Meet regulatory requirements** <br/>
  Automated documentation generation (notification letters, audit PDFs) supports CMS compliance and payer reporting obligations.

### Use Case
<details>
  <summary>Click to learn more about the prior authorization use case</summary>

  | Scenario | Persona | Challenges | Solution Approach |
  |----------|---------|------------|-------------------|
  | PA intake triage | Utilization Review Nurse | Manually checking demographics, provider credentials, codes, and clinical notes quality for completeness is time-consuming and error-prone. | **Compliance Agent** validates all required documentation in seconds with a 10-item checklist: items 1-7 are blocking; item 9 flags NCCI CPT bundling risk; item 10 classifies service type (Procedure/Medication/Imaging/Device/Therapy/Facility) for downstream routing. |
  | Clinical evidence review | Medical Director | Extracting structured clinical data, validating ICD-10 codes, and searching PubMed for supporting evidence takes 15–30 minutes per case. | **Clinical Reviewer Agent** automates clinical data extraction, code validation, and literature/trial search using MCP-connected healthcare data sources. |
  | Coverage policy evaluation | PA Coordinator | Looking up Medicare NCDs/LCDs, mapping each policy criterion to clinical evidence, and documenting medical necessity assessments is manual and inconsistent. | **Coverage Agent** searches CMS coverage databases, verifies provider credentials, and produces auditable MET/NOT_MET/INSUFFICIENT criterion mappings. |
  | Final decision synthesis | Clinical Reviewer | Combining findings from multiple reviewers into a consistent, auditable recommendation with confidence scoring requires significant coordination. | **Orchestrator + Synthesis** evaluates a gate-based rubric (Provider → Codes → Medical Necessity), produces a recommendation with confidence scores, and generates notification letters and audit PDFs. |

### Security guidelines

This solution accelerator handles **Protected Health Information (PHI)** and clinical data. Security best practices are critical for any deployment.

**This project uses keyless authentication throughout — no API keys, passwords, or connection strings are stored anywhere.** All Azure resource access (Microsoft Foundry, Azure Container Registry, Azure Monitor) is authenticated via [`DefaultAzureCredential`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/python/sdk/authentication/credential-chains#defaultazurecredential-overview):

| Environment | Credential used | How it's granted |
|---|---|---|
| Azure (production) | System-assigned [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) on each Container App; deployer user identity | Bicep role assignments at deploy time (`CognitiveServicesOpenAIUser` for backend, `CognitiveServicesOpenAIContributor` + `Azure AI User` for Foundry project MI, `Azure AI User` + `Azure AI Project Manager` for deployer) |
| Local / Codespaces | Azure Developer CLI token (`azd auth login`) or Azure CLI token (`az login`) | Developer's own authenticated session |

Because there are no API keys, there is nothing to rotate, leak, or accidentally commit. To ensure continued best practices in your own repository, we recommend enabling [GitHub secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) to catch any credentials that might be inadvertently introduced.

You may want to consider additional security measures, such as:

* Enabling [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/) to secure your Azure resources.
