"""Synthesis Decision Hosted Agent — refreshed Foundry Hosted Agents preview.

Synthesizes outputs from Compliance, Clinical, and Coverage agents into
a final APPROVE or PEND recommendation using gate-based evaluation,
weighted confidence scoring, and a structured audit trail.

Deployed as a Foundry Hosted Agent using the refreshed preview stack:
  - FoundryChatClient (agent-framework-foundry) — model bridge
  - Agent (agent-framework-core)                — agent definition + tools
  - ResponsesHostServer (agent-framework-foundry-hosting) — HTTP host

No MCP connections required — synthesis is pure reasoning over agent outputs.
Structured output is enforced via default_options={"response_format": SynthesisOutput},
which the host passes through to every agent.run() call. The `store: False`
option is required by the refreshed preview because the platform now manages
conversation history.
